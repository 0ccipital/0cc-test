let's plan out how we can improve using the program further, I'm going to give you a bullet point list of items to consider, then we will go through them one by one:

- branching behavior:
    - this will be a big component now, so properly adhering to best principles working with trees should apply, including the way we store, operate on, and trees and the data structure we are using for it.
    - example scenario: messaging the llm creates state_1, then another message creates state_2,revert to state_1, then another messages creates state_3_a
    - right now you can't change branch to state_2 once you have reverting to previous branch state_1. I would rather be able to fully move around the tree. rather than just revert, the user should be able to go to any point in the tree and be able to navigate it easily.
    - the example scenario should create a new state as a branch of state_1, right now it's state_3_a with no indication as to how it fits into the tree at all.

- save/load
    - there should be a /save, /load, and /new to save an existing context to a file name by default within a subfolder trees/ and given a good name that should be selectable and resumable, including tags when using /load, using the same directory by default. /new should clear the current tree and provide a new context tree

- ui
    - the text from the model output should be streaming, right now it waits and then all pops in at once
    - clearing the screen on some actions is not helpful, I would rather it never clear the screen other than using /clear. this should be easy and not require much discussion
    - the selection of slash commands should offer a second shorter choice for some major functions, this should be easy and not require much discussion. for example:
        - /s /states
        - /t /tag
        - /r /revert
        - /q /quit
    - we need to handle state selection better to quickly get to the desired branch. we should consider naming, ui, and the visual represenation of the tree in order to make recognizing and selecting the desired branch easier. the tree can be represented as integers, with the user typing the number in. as the number is entered, a shortened version of the prompt in one color, and the reponse in another color could be displayed below the number selection. it should happen while the user is typing, so for example they type 1 and the 1 state should be displayed, then they type another 1 to make "11" and the 11 state should be dislpayed. When the user hits enter, the desired branch should be selected.

- tags
    - rather than the current tag choices, the user will provide their own tag text that may be short, or may be long, so we need to plan on how this would effect visuals
    - remove the fast tag selection after a response is returned, the user will only use /t or /tag to write a tag for the current branch
    - using /t or /tag with nothing after it should open up a menu to enter a tag and suggest the past 5 unique tags
    - using /t or /tag with text following should use that as the tag name to quickly tag a branch

- writing/designing/coding
    - this is turning into a fully fledged cli program. from other prominent or well regarded cli programs, what types of further enhancements or new additions could this program benefit from?
    - I want the code to follow stricter coding principles used for cli applications like this in the community

to answer your questions:
1. let's use the hierarchical names as "id" and integers as a chronological state number like "4 (1.2.1)" to show the 4th created node is at 1.2.1
2. goto and cd, both should be navigateable by integer or id, showing the selection while typing whether its 4 or 1.2.1 for example
3. streaming by default
4. no templates or imports
5. tags should be flat and just simple text and color


further:
- rather than reinvent the wheel, let's use good existing methods for keeping the necesary information in a tree, and use best practices and try and be bullet proof
- the /t command should not require quotes
    - right now it says:
        - /t "debugging memory leak" 
    - when it should be:
        - /t debugging memory leak
- frequently used tags are good but we shouldn't try to be contextually aware based on conversation content, only what is short, quick, and easy to implement
- /config and functionality is not needed
- help system and functionality is not needed
- output formatting and functionality is not needed
- the interactive mode to browse the tree is a good idea, that's what I want to nagivate the tree and maybe something like the selection menu where a shortened version of the state contents is shown while typing
- logging and testing is not needed yet, but should be added later
- performance and stability is critical as the machine will likely be resource strained runnnig the instance of ollama. for example I am running gemma3n 4b 4-bit on a mac m3 pro with 18gb ram
